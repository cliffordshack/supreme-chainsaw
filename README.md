# Sadducean Survival Atlas

*A Forensic-Historical Continuity Analysis, 70–2025 CE*

This repository contains the **Sadducean Survival Atlas**, a speculative yet evidence-based framework reconstructing plausible survival and adaptation pathways for Sadducean elite networks after 70 CE.  

The work challenges the conventional "extinction" narrative and traces three major phases of transformation:

## 📜 Contents
- **Phase I:** Roman & Byzantine Integration (70–500 CE)
- **Phase II:** Medieval Transmutation (500–1500 CE)
- **Phase III:** Modern Technocratic Priesthood (1500–2025 CE)
- **Diagnostic Fingerprints**
- **Verification Methodology**
- **Conclusion**

## 🧠 Purpose
The Atlas is designed for historians, political scientists, and researchers interested in:
- Institutional continuity across civilizational transitions.
- The evolution of administrative elites.
- The interplay between law, finance, and governance.

## 📂 Files

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This work is **speculative historical analysis**. While grounded in archival and structural evidence, it should be read as a hypothesis inviting further research.
